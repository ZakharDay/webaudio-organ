This webapp was built so that any individual with a usb midi controller and a compatiable web browser can have access to the Farfisa sound for performance, recording, or education. Specifically, this organ requires your browser to have Web Audio and Web MIDI API's to be fully functional. Currently Google Chrome is your best bet but all web broswers are constantly being updated so compatibility will likely improve with time.
